# Task 1: Poster Design - Code Alpha Internship

Welcome to the *Poster Design Project* repository for my internship at *Code Alpha*! This task is the first assignment completed during my graphic design internship, focusing on creating an engaging and visually effective poster.

## Project Overview

The goal of this task was to design a poster that captures attention and communicates the message clearly and effectively. Through this project, I aimed to apply graphic design principles such as color harmony, typography, and layout arrangement to create a professional and compelling design.

## Design Highlights

- *Color Scheme*: Carefully chosen to evoke the intended emotions and reinforce the poster's message.
- *Typography*: Selected fonts to ensure readability and complement the visual style of the poster.
- *Layout*: Balanced elements with thoughtful placement to guide the viewerâ€™s eye smoothly across the poster.

## Learnings and Skills Applied

This project allowed me to:
- Refine my layout and composition skills.
- Improve my ability to convey messages visually.
- Gain hands-on experience with design software.
